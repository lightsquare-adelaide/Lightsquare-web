/**
 * Sanitise a `?next=` redirect target so that login can only send the user
 * to a path on this site.
 *
 * `startsWith("/")` on its own is not enough. `//example.com` is a
 * scheme-relative URL, and browsers (and the WHATWG URL parser) also read
 * `/\example.com` as `//example.com`. Next's router treats both as external
 * and performs a hard navigation, which would turn `?next=` into an open
 * redirect after a successful login.
 *
 * Two independent checks: a shape test on the raw string, then a parse
 * against a fixed origin to confirm the target resolves to that origin.
 * The result is rebuilt from the parsed parts so the caller never sees the
 * raw input.
